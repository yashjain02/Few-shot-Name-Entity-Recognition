# The Vectors

## Developed a web-app for Named Entity Recognition having different features like:

Named-Entity Recognition using user-defined classes
Named-Entity Recognition using pre-defined classes
Text summarization and Named-Entity Recognition using Web-scrapping
Process a document (example: cv), and highlight the important classes (eg. skills)


## Install

pip install concise-concepts
pip install spacy-streamlit
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


## Concise Concepts

When wanting to apply NER to concise concepts, it is really easy to come up with examples, but pretty difficult to train an entire pipeline. Concise Concepts uses few-shot NER based on word embedding similarity to get you going with easy! Now with entity scoring!


## Spacy streamlit

This package contains utilities for visualizing spaCy models and building interactive spaCy-powered apps with Streamlit.
